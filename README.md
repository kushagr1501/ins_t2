## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Architectural Components

1. **Cryptographic Primitives Layer**
   - Uses `cryptography` library for core cryptographic operations
   - Implements secure key generation and management
   - Supports multiple encryption algorithms and modes

2. **Key Management Subsystem**
   - Handles key generation, storage, and revocation
   - Maintains a JSON-based revoked keys registry
   - Provides secure key loading with revocation checks

3. **Certificate Management Module**
   - Supports X.509 certificate lifecycle management
   - Implements Root CA and user certificate workflows
   - Provides certificate verification and revocation mechanisms

4. **Encryption Services**
   - Symmetric Encryption (AES-CBC with PKCS7 padding)
   - Asymmetric Encryption (RSA with OAEP padding)
   - Secure key exchange (Diffie-Hellman)

5. **User Interface**
   - Interactive command-line menu
   - User-friendly cryptographic operations selection

## üåê Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Implementation

### PKI Components and Workflow

#### 1. Root Certificate Authority (Root CA)
- Generates a self-signed root certificate
- Acts as the trusted anchor for the entire PKI
- Uses 2048-bit RSA key for maximum compatibility
- Certificate includes:
  - Distinguished Name (DN) information
  - Basic Constraints (CA=True)
  - 10-year validity period

#### 2. Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Generation
- Allows creation of user/entity certificates
- Includes organizational and personal details
- Supports standard X.509 certificate attributes
- Generates a unique private key for each CSR

#### 3. Certificate Signing Process
- Root CA signs user certificates
- Applies digital signature using Root CA's private key
- Implements cryptographic verification mechanisms
- Sets certificate validity (default: 1 year)

#### 4. Certificate Revocation
- Supports Certificate Revocation List (CRL) management
- Allows immediate invalidation of compromised certificates
- Provides real-time revocation status checking

### PKI Security Features
- Hierarchical trust model
- Cryptographically secure certificate signing
- Comprehensive certificate lifecycle management
- Detailed revocation tracking
- Support for multiple organizational units
